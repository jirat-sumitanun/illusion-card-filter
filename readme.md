If you want to modify it to filter Honey Select or PlayHome card or other game from Illusion.

I will guide you a litte below.

```
Playhome
- female character card => PlayHome_Female
- scene => PHStudio

Honey select
- female character card => HoneySelectCharaFemale
- scene => honey

if not two games above. you can search "IEND®B`‚" in png file for some keyword.
if it chracter card, you will see a keyword near "IEND®B`‚" to the right.
if it scene, you can search "studio" but if not found just go to the end of the file you will see some keyword.
if it coordinate, you can search "clothes"

```
